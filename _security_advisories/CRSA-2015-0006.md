title: 'OpenDaylight SQLite memory corruption leading to DoS and possible code execution'

description: 'The Helium release of AAA uses SQL statements assembled using string concatenation of user-supplied variables. This theoretically exposes an SQL injection vulnerability, but testing has revealed no cases that could cross a trust boundary and be useful to an attacker. However, as a result of allowing users to directly manipulate SQL statements, AAA exposes two underlying memory corruption vulnerabilities in SQLite (CVE-2015-3414 and CVE-2015-3416). Another vulnerability in SQLite was also reported (CVE-2015-3415), but AAA does not expose this vulnerability, because it relies on injection of DDL and AAA only allows an attacker to inject DML.'

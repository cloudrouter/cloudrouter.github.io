I am Jay Turner, project lead for CloudRouter.  Prior to joining IIX
Inc, I spent 16 years as a part of Red Hat's Quality Engineering team,
working on everything from Anaconda, to Red Hat Satellite, to Red Hat
CloudForms.  I am thankful to IIX for allowing me to bring those years
of open source software experience and dedication to the launch of the
CloudRouter Project.  Allow me and my team to introduce you to
CloudRouter.

With the rapid migration of compute resources from physical
infrastructure to a combination of physical, virtual, and cloud
environments, changes are afoot in the networking space.  Where once
networking control logic was strictly relegated to proprietary
hardware-based platforms, we are seeing broader adoption of open source
software-based platforms.  We initiated the CloudRouter Project in order
to simplify this migration to the cloud without forcing users to abandon
control over network routing and governance.

I want to build a thriving community around the CloudRouter Project,
producing a healthy project optimized for interconnection, and designed
to run both in the cloud as well as on-premise.  CloudRouter will be
both highly scalable, and offer high performance with minimal resource
consumption.  Finally, and most importantly, security has been a
foundation of CloudRouter development, and will continue to be going
forward.  I am thankful to have David Jorm on the team to oversee all
aspects of security.

CloudRouter is based on Fedora 20 plus updates, and includes several
pre-installed packages to support software-defined interconnect, such as
OpenDaylight (Helium SR2 is included in the beta).  As
of today CloudRouter is available as a pre-configured disk image (the
KVM hypervisor is recommended), a Docker image, and an OSv image.

A successful, thriving open source community results from broad
participation including development, test and validation, creation of
documentation, content translation, promoting the project, and
participation on mailing lists and forums.  I invite all to join
[users@lists,cloudrouter.org](http://lists.cloudrouter.org/mailman/listinfo/users/)
 for discussion of CloudRouter usage, and [devel@lists.cloudrouter.org](http://lists.cloudrouter.org/mailman/listinfo/devel/)
 for discussion of CloudRouter development.
More information concerning the CloudRouter community can be found in
[Community]({{ site.baseurl }}/community/).  And for those interested in
jumping into CloudRouter itself can visit
[Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/).

With the first CloudRouter beta available, we intend to pick up the pace
of development including the addition of new features, code hardening,
bug fixes, and performance improvements.  The team values your input and
love to start our mornings with a cup of coffee and a pile of pull
requests!  Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudrouter) and help
contribute to CloudRouter's success!

Thanks,
Jay Turner
CloudRouter Project Lead

# Governance

CloudRouter is a collaborative open source project, open to everyone. Critical to maintaining this openness is an open governance structure. CloudRouter's governance is primarily handled by two teams of volunteers: the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Both teams are run as meritocricies, and anyone can be elected by a vote of the existing members.

## Project Steering Committee (PSC)

The PSC provides overall guidance and strategy for the project, including but not limited to:

* Legal compliance & licensing
* Policies and procedures
* Events and marketing
* Developer and user outreach

The PSC is currently comprised of the following members:

* Jay Turner <jkt@iix.net>
* David Jorm <djorm@iix.net>

New members of the PSC are currently being sought. If you are interested in applying, please email <cloudrouter-psc@googlegroups.com>.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC provides technical leadership, direction, and decision making for the project. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Code repos and coding standards
* Design and operation of the build system
* QE and testing procedures
* Release engineering
* Inclusion of packages

The TSC is currently comprised of the following members:

* Chandrasekar Kannan <ckannan@iix.net>
* Arun Neelicattu <abn@iix.net>

New members of the TSC are currently being sought. If you are interested in applying, please email <cloudrouter-tsc@googlegroups.com>.

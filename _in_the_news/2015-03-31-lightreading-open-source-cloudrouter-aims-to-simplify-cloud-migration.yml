excerpt: CloudRouter can run on bare metal, as a virtual image in a hypervisor, or in container images in the cloud, Turner says. The software "incorporates the latest release of OpenDaylight to provide secure network programmability to enable software-defined networking (SDN) and create a solid foundation for network function virtualization (NFV) for networks at any size and scale," CloudRouter said in a statement. The project will "maintain a stable and up-to-date Linux distribution."
